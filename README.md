Introduction
      Credit scoring is a crucial aspect of risk assessment for banks, allowing them to evaluate the creditworthiness of customers and make informed lending decisions. This project focuses on developing a predictive 
model to help Bank GoodCredit predict credit scores for current credit card customers.By analyzing customer data and credit history, the model aims to identify customers with higher credit scores, reducing the risk 
of credit default and improving overall risk management.

Features:

- Data Preprocessing: Perform data cleaning, feature engineering, and transformation to prepare the dataset for modeling.
- Model Development: Implement machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc., to build predictive models.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of each model using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared to assess predictive accuracy.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune the hyperparameters of the models using techniques such as grid search cross-validation to optimize performance.
- Feature Importance Analysis: Identify key features that influence credit scores and gain insights into factors affecting creditworthiness.
- Model Deployment: Deploy the final model into production environment for real-time credit score prediction and integration with banking systems.
